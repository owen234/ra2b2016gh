   I run this code on strange.ucr.edu after copying the production root files from the FNAL LPC.

   The slimming step only saves the necessary TTree variables and also computes and adds
   a few new ones to the output TTree.  For the data, it adds these booleans
     pass_pfmet100_trig
     pass_pfmetnomu100_trig
   that are necessary to ensure only events that pass the correct trigger(s) are used.
