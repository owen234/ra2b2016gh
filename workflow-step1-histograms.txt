  Before doing any of the stuff below, you will need to have a local copy of
  the analysis root files.  The code as written below expects it to be in
  these sub directories

    fnal-prod-v9-skims
    fnal-prod-v9-skims-slimmed

  See the slim-code subdirectory on how to make slimmed files.



 -------
  data_turnon1.c
      input is slimmed data
      output is outputfiles/data-turnon.root
      from the command line
        .L data_turnon1.c
        data_turnon1()

 -------
  run_fill_hists_loop_v2d.c  ( uses fill_hists_loop_v2d.c )
      input is slimmed skims of QCD MC and outputfiles/data-turnon.root file above for QCD fake-met
      output is
         outputfiles/hists-v2c-qcd.root
      from the command line
         .L run_fill_hists_loop_v2d.c
         run_fill_hists_loop_v2d()

 -------
  *** Optional.  Not used for AN material ***
  run_fill_hists_loop_v2c.c (uses fill_hists_loop_v2c.c)
      input is slimmed skims and outputfiles/data-turnon.root file above for QCD fake-met
         trigger turn-on.
      output is 
         outputfiles/hists-v2c-hadtau.root
         outputfiles/hists-v2c-lostlep.root
         outputfiles/hists-v2c-znunu.root
      from the command line
         .L run_fill_hists_loop_v2c.c
         run_fill_hists_loop_v2c()

 -------
  fill_data_hists_loop_v2d.c
      input is slimmed skims (MET dataset!)
      output is outputfiles/hists-data-v2d.root
      from the command line
         .L fill_data_hists_loop_v2d.c
         fill_data_hists_loop_v2d f
         f.Loop()
